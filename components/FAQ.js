                        We want you to be so excited about every item you purchase from us, so, if you don't love your garment, send it back!
                        To begin processing your return please go to: returns.heysassy.com
                        We offer full refunds on all regular priced items but there is $5 restocking fee per garment.
                        The restocking fee is waived if you opt to get your return in the form of store credit however.
                        Once a return arrives on site it will take a few days for us to confirm that the item was returned undamaged and in 
                        good condition. We aim to process returns as quickly as possible, but it may take up to 10 days after it’s delivered 
                        back to us for your item to be refunded.  Please do not

                    Please keep in mind that we make our clothes in very limited batches and so we may not be able

                    We offer Route package protection automatically on all orders to protect against this exact issue. You can file a 
                    claim directly through Route to get a refund or a replacement. If you are a dingdong and opted out of this protection 
                    there is nothing we can do to help you with this issue.
